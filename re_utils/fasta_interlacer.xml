**What it does**
 This tools joins paired end FASTA reads from separate files, one with the left mates and one with the right mates, into a single files.
 Last character in identifiers is used to distinguish pairs.
  
**Note !!!**
 This tools is to be used as more efficient replacement of FASTQ interlacer. Galaxy built-in FASTQ interlacer allows different ordering
 of sequences in both files but this flexibility comes with high memory requirements when large files are used. FASTA interlacer is simple but order of magnitude 
 faster tools which can be used on files where reads are in the same order.
